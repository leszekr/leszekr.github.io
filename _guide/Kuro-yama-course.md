## Points of interest

 - Kaburi pass
 - Kasasugi pass
 - Kuroyama santaki

## Access

The quickest way to get to Agano station (吾野駅) from Tokyo is via the Seibu Ikebukuro express towards Nagatoro　(長瀞).

## Course

From Agano station north exit, walk east on the road until you cross the bridge. From there, you want to head north, following signs to Kaburi pass (顔振峠).

Shortly before Kaburi pass, there's a wonderful view of the rural area and mt. Fuji in the distance, if weather permits. Kaburi pass hosts some restaurants, there's a big map and a slew of signs. Follow the sign to Kasasugi pass (傘杉峠), not the path that goes up.

From Kasasugi pass, turn right (east) towards Kuroyama Santaki (黒山三滝). The waterfalls used to be a training center for monks who practise ascetism. You'll meet groups of tourists, some of whom came by car. You may enjoy grilled fish-on-a-stick or stay in a hotel or relax in Kurotaki Onsen here.

From the waterfall area, walk down the paved road until you reach the city. There's a bus stop there, with busses leaving once per hour to Ogose station. Walk along the road there, watching your right to for the place where the hiking course starts again.

At some point the mountain path ends in an orchard area which turns into a residential area. You'll see a toilet on your left and on your right, a staircase leading up to a shrine. There's a giant bell and a sign saying, basically "Enjoy!" (楽しんで下さい). At the shrine, turn right and continue on the hiking course to Ogose station (越生駅).

Take this course in November for wonderful views of red leaves.
