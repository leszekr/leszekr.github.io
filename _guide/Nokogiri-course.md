## Access

Okutama station is on the Chuo line. It's the last station for many Chuo line trains, so you can't miss it.

## Course

From Okutama station, head right. There's a local store where you can supply your lunch box and get some water. Cross the road and the bridge. On your left, there's the Hikawa camp site, on your right - a map and stairs. Go right.

There will be a very rough map of the course at a fork. Take the path which is marked by a staircase - the other way will take you to the residential area. After a while on a hiking path, you'll reach a long staircase leading up to Atago Shrine.

After Atago Shrine, follow the course to Nokogiri-yama (鋸山). The course is straightforward. There are some ups and downs, with metal staircases where climbing would be otherwise very challenging.

Past Nokogiri-yama, you'll reach the road. There's a toilet and some containers. Don't follow the road yet, at this point. Continue down on the hiking path on the other side.

When you do reach the road, it's a long walk back to Okutama. Although on the other end of the city, Moegi onsen (もえぎの湯) is well worth a visit.
