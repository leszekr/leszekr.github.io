My university is the soul of the city. Even if you're just a regular citizen, you can't help but be constantly reminded that there is research going on around you. Just  outside the city centre, there's the Institute of Physics and the Etnograpical Park. The Liberal Arts are in the old town, next to the Planetarium and not far from the Centre of Modern Technologies. The Departament of Mathematics is by the river with the Institute of Arts not too far from there. You can take a bus to the main campus, hosting Chemistry, Economy and Law, among others. And if you venture out of town, among vast forests and fields, you'll find a giant dish listening to waves from the stars, belonging to the Institute of Astronomy.

Also in the main campus area, you'll find the library and the dormitories. The dorms offer low-cost shared rooms to those who need them the most. Since the rooms are limited, shared housing is the second popular option. Renting a whole apartment with a group of four or five friends helps save cost and support each other. In either case, it can be pretty crowded, so a lot of mutual respect and understanding is required. Conflicts happen, but I also know of some great friendships and more than one marriage that started with sharing a kitchen.

Where students meet, parties happen. The dormitory area is a regular party place. But once every year, around May, for three or four days, students completely take over the city. The main campus area and the riverside become party grounds with outdoor live music, movies, snacks and a lot of alcohol. A bit like the Japanese hanami season, or a rock concert.

After the wild party come the exams. The streets are quiet as students nervously prepare for their knowledge to be tested. Sometimes we gathered into study groups and solved textbook problems together. Sometimes we got our hands on copies of exam questions from previous years. Stacks of xeroxed sheets were passed from generation to generation in a constant battle of wits. Professors retaliated by designing questions that were deceivingly similar, but different in a crucial way. All in the spirit of keeping things fresh. The relationship between students and professors is usually on the positive side, often friendly. In Poland, like in Japan, we normally use someone's family name in formal situations, but younger staff often prefer or even insist on students using their first name.

[The Science and Arts Festival](http://www.festiwal.torun.pl/galeria/) is another annual event. Faculty and students prepare public lectures or interactive presentations showcasing their research. You can hear about ancient cultures, learn first aid, play with dry ice or look through a telescope. The lecture halls open up to families with children and wide-eyed high schoolers. I once gave a talk about robotics, which was very popular with kids.

Having grown up in that atmosphere, for me it wasn't a question of *if* I go to the university, but what I would study. I've seen it from the point of view of an undergraduate student, grad student and as university staff. I ended up spending ten great years there. At some point, I decided to move to Japan, but Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland will forever be my Alma mater.

If I were to change one thing, it would be this: more international student exchange. If you're considering studying abroad, Polish universities can offer you an adventure of a life time. Polish people are famous for their hospitality and most other students will speak English, or even Japanese to you. In fact, Japanese Studies has been one of the most popular of the new university courses. The nearby SHARP and ORION factories brought a wave of interest in Japanese culture, to the point where even small restaurants in the Old Town have menus in katakana. Please check the [NCU student exchange][1] programme and do consider Torun in Poland.
