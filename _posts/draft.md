title: Three years

So... This is what being left behind feels like.

I'm now past the third year at my current job. While it may not sound significant, it's the longest I've been working for one company. I've done some job hopping in my career, for various reasons. I often think of my ex-coworkers, especially now, when I'm the one who has been left behind by others.

In my first year at the company, I met the people I'd be working with. 

The people who joined in my second year are awesome, but I had already formed my "comfort zone group". 

In my third year, I realised that I stayed long enough to witness the natural churn of employees in an IT workplace. Most of the people I have worked with since my first year have moved on in their careers. 

Despite starting the fourth year at this job, it feels more like starting anew, rather than settling down. It's a new feeling for me: being the older, more experienced team member. While I'm used to forming new relationships from the newcomer point of view, now I mostly get to form relationships with newcomers. So, in a way, being left behind is a new experience for me. A new adventure.
