title: Goodbye, three years!
---

So... This is what being left behind feels like.

This year, the fourth year at my current job has started. While it may not sound significant, it's the longest I've been working for one company. I've done my share of job hopping in my career, either due to some changes in the company, or simply because a much better opportunity came up. I often think of my ex-coworkers, especially now, when I'm the one beimg left behind by others.

In my first year, I met the people I'd be working with. The people who joined in my second year are awesome, but I had already formed my "comfort zone group". In my third year, many of the first-year colleagues moved on in their careers. No, people aren't jumping ship. There is no mass exodus. It's just me - I stayed long enough in one place to witness the natural churn of IT employees. 

Despite starting the fourth year at this job, it feels more like starting anew, rather than settling down. It's a new feeling for me: being the older, more experienced team member. While I'm used to forming new relationships from the newcomer point of view, now I mostly get to form relationships with newcomers. So, in a way, being left behind is a new experience for me. A new adventure.
