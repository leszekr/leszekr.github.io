  Legends say that Mt. Kuki's name (九鬼山, nine demons) is because Momotaro, the boy born from a peach, fought the devil on top of the mountain. A slightly challenging course, involving long, steep climbs and equally steep descend. Not for beginners, although frequented by older people. Best when the skies are clear, so you can see Mt Fuji from several viewpoints. About 5 hours walking time.

 - Mt. Kuki

 - breathtaking viewpoints
 - view of Mt Fuji

## Access

From Shinjuku, take the Chuo line (express, if possible) to Otsuki (大月駅). In Otsuki, switch to Fujikyu Railway line. **Note: IC cards don't work on this line.** You'll have to buy a ¥290 ticket from the machine, so make sure you have enough time, since there could be a line.

The course starts from Kasei station (禾生駅) on the Fujikyu line.

## Course

From the east exit of the station (with the station attendant), head left along the main road. There'll be a convenience store on your right. If you haven't used the little toilet at the station, you'll want to use this one, since there are no toilets on this course.

Continue along the road until you cross Asahigawa river (朝日川) on Ochiai bridge (落合橋), turn right and walk under the brick bridge, following signs to Kuki-yama (九鬼山) or "mountain path" in Japanese: 登山道. You'll come across a choice between a forest path and a path involving a temple. They take about the same amount of time. We took the forest path.

The path is narrow and a bit steep, with little space for stopping, but the shimmering stream and the various trees and flowers are great companions here. Watch your left - there's a clearing where you can see the majestic Mt. Fuji.

The top of Mt. Kuki comes as a bit of a surprise. It has a wide, panoramic view to the west (so no Mt. Fuji). There are some makeshift benches, but there will be another good spot for a lunch break later, if you're patient. Shortly after the top, there's another clearing with a Mt. Fuji view and a path going back down to Kasei station. Continue on the mountain path (登山道) to a crossing, where you want to turn left. Soon after, there's another clearing, great for lunch in the sunshine.

You'll be going up Madate-yama (馬立山) from there. There's a fork on the way, which you may miss if you're not careful: one path goes to the left and down (and would end your hike too early), the other is barely visible and goes straight ahead and upwards. Go up. This part of the course has some paths where you have to be careful not to slip, or you might slide down the steep slope. 

Madate-yama summit is not really special. From the top, climb down **slowly** to the east. The sign points to Saruhashi station (猿橋駅). Watch your left again. There's a path to your left which you want to take. If you miss it, the path slowly disappears with no warning or signs. If you feel like you're walking east too long, **go back and find the right path**.

Before you reach Gozenyama (御前山), there's a very interesting rock formation. You can walk up to see it up close, but eventually, you want to be on the path going right of the rocks. The path left of the rocks is marked as dangerous on the map and you would miss the actual top of Gozenyama.

The top is not along the course, you'll have to climb up and track back later, but the view from the top is the absolute highlight of the course. You'll be sitting on rocks, looking at the mountains spread around you. Otsuki-city houses sprinkled below in the forest.

After Gozenyama, the last mountaintop is Kagurayama (?) (神楽山). Optional. The rest of the path is a slightly steep climb down to Saruhashi station (猿橋駅).
