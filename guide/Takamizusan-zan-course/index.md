## Course

From Ikusabata Station (軍畑駅), go out of the only ticket gate.  There are toilets on your right, and a narrow road on your left which runs along the tracks.  Take this road, which goes under the tracks veers to the right afterwards.  Take it about 5-10 minutes (not going on the side roads on your left), and it comes to a bigger road.  Turn left there. This whole course is very well-marked so you shouldn’t have any problems.

Walk up this road about 20 minutes and you’ll see a sign on the right going to Mt. Takamizu (高水山).  Go up this path and you’ll see a small shrine on the right.  Continue up the path and it becomes a hiking path.  Continue following the signs to the 3 mountains mentioned above and enjoy 3 and a half hours of up and down walking through beautiful forests (pine, bamboo, etc) and splendid views from the three peaks on your way to Mitake Station (御嶽駅).

At the end of the hike, you cross the railroad tracks and reach a big road.  Mitake station is 1 minute up the road on your right. Before going there, cross the road and turn left, stop by the 7-11 to buy a well-deserved drink and walk down the stairs nearby to the wonderful Tama River. It’s the perfect place to finish off the hike.
