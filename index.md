I'm a developer based in Tokyo, JAPAN, originally from Torun, POLAND.

I had some [publications related to neural networks](https://umk.academia.edu/LeszekRybicki) in the past and enjoyed data visualization

Due to circumstances, I turned into a full-stack web developer. As such, I have experience in:

 - [Sails](http://sailsjs.org/) (javascript)
 - [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) (ruby)
 - [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) (python)

on the back-end and:

 - [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)
 - [D3](http://d3js.org/)
 - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

on the front-end side.

I enjoy outdoor activities like <a href="http://jambointernational.org">hiking in the Japanese mountains.</a>
