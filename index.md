I'm a developer based in Tokyo, JAPAN, originally from [Torun, POLAND](http://www.torun.pl/en).

I had some [publications related to neural networks](https://umk.academia.edu/LeszekRybicki) in the past. I especially enjoyed reinforcement learning and data visualization.

Currently, I'm working at [Cookpad](https://info.cookpad.com/), R&D department, working on image analysis using deep neural networks. My tools include:

 - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
 - [Keras](https://keras.io)
 - [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io)
 - [Chainer](http://chainer.org)
