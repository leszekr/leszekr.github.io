title: Hello

I'm a developer based in Tokyo, JAPAN, originally from [Torun, POLAND](http://www.torun.pl/en).

I wear many hats.

Sometimes I'm a matematician. I love the aspect of math where I get to solve a puzzle. The answer is out there, dictated by the laws of logic.

I can be creative. I enjoy making data easy to see and pleasant for the eyes. I'm driven by making user-focused products. Nothing makes me more proud than the thought that something I created is useful to someone. 

I believe that technology, be it hardawre, software or services should be designed in a way to improve, rather than replace, human beings. Enhance our senses, sharpen our memory and focus our thoughts.

Currently, I'm working at [Cookpad](https://info.cookpad.com/)'s R&D department, on image-related tasks using deep neural networks. My tools include:

 - [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
 - [Keras](https://keras.io)
 - [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io)
